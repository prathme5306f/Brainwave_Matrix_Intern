Requirements:

As we use python we need to download python 1st.

To check if Python is installed, open the command prompt (cmd) and type:-  python --version
 
It should return something like:- Python 3.x.x

Before running the program, install the necessary libraries in VS Code’s terminal. Open VS Code, then go to Terminal → New Terminal, and run:- pip install requests bs4 validators googlesearch-python

This installs:-
requests → To check URLs
bs4 (BeautifulSoup) → For web scraping (optional)
validators → To validate URL formats
googlesearch-python → To check if the domain appears in Google search results


 OR

pip install requests validators googlesearch-python
(as per need in code)


This will install:-

requests → For handling web requests
validators → For URL validation
googlesearch-python → To check if a domain appears in Google


Verify Installation
After installing, check if Python recognizes the modules by running:-
python -c "import requests, validators, googlesearch; print('Modules installed successfully!')"
If you see "Modules installed successfully!", you’re good to go.


Alternative Solution (If pip Doesn't Work)
If pip install gives an error, try:- python -m pip install requests validators googlesearch-python



need to install google search if you use googlesearch for scanning for this:- pip install requests bs4 validators googlesearch-python
